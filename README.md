## Installing
1. Copy VoxCake folder to your Unity project.
2. You don`t need the second step, youre ready to create great things!
3. You also don`t need the third step :D

## First steps
Well, i think that at first, you would see the fast results, dont you?
Okay, let`s create your first voxel volume in few lines of code! To make that you should:
1. Put map into StreammingAssets folder
2. Make GameObject and attach this script
```csharp
using VoxCake;
using UnityEngine;

public class MapExample : Volume
{
    private void Start()
    {
        LoadNearCamera("pathToYourMap", UColor.RGBAToUint(86, 93, 110, 100), Camera.main);
    }
    private void Update()
    {
        Render();
    }
}
```

## Load model
To load model in format .vox(for example) you should:
1. Put model into StreammingAssets/Models folder
2. Make GameObject with MeshFiler and MeshRenderer components and attach this script
```csharp
using VoxCake;
using UnityEngine;

public class ModelExample : Volume
{
    private void Start()
    {
		ResourceManager.Init();
        MaterialManager.Init();
        GetComponent<MeshFilter>().mesh = ResourceManager.GetModel("pathToYourModel", PlayerTeam.Green);
		GetComponent<MeshRenderer>().material = MaterialManager.model;
    }
}
```
